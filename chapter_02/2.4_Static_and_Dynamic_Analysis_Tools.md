## 2.4: Static and Dynamic Analysis Tools

Modern C++ development emphasizes not only writing correct code, but also ensuring code **quality**, **performance**, and **maintainability** throughout the software lifecycle. *Static* and *dynamic* analysis tools play a fundamental role in achieving these goals. They complement compiler diagnostics with deep code inspection, error detection, and compliance checks, enabling programmers to deliver robust and secure C++ codebases.

This section provides a comprehensive overview of both static and dynamic analysis, explains crucial terminology, covers widely used tools (with focus on modern, real-world workflows), demonstrates integration with the build process, and establishes best practices for leveraging these tools effectively.

### 1. Static Analysis

**Static analysis** examines code *without executing it*. Its purpose is to detect bugs, code smells, security flaws, and violations of best practices early in the development cycle. Unlike compiler errors, advanced static analysis checks for subtle issues such as possible null dereferences, resource leaks, incorrect use of APIs, or non-portable constructs.

#### Main Concepts

- **Linting**: Checks code for stylistic, formatting, and simple correctness issues. Example: *missing semicolons, bad naming*.
- **Deep static analysis**: Detects logic errors (e.g., buffer overflows, use-after-free, data races in multithreaded code).
- **Coding standards compliance**: Ensures code adheres to style guides like **Google C++ Style Guide**, **Autodesk C++ Guidelines**, or **MISRA C++** for safety-critical domains.

#### Popular Static Analysis Tools for C++

| Tool                        | Type        | Notable Features                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **clang-tidy**              | Linter/Analyzer | Modern C++ aware, integrates with Clang; checks for style, API usage, bugs; extensible |
| **Cppcheck**                | Analyzer    | No dependency on compiler; focuses on bugs and undefined behavior, simple setup           |
| **Clang Static Analyzer**   | Analyzer    | In-depth path-sensitive analysis, integrated in Clang tools                            |
| **PVS-Studio**              | Commercial  | Powerful, sophisticated diagnostics, major IDE/build system integration                |
| **SonarQube**               | Platform    | Web-based code quality dashboard, integrates static analysis from multiple tools         |
| **Coverity Scan**           | Commercial/Cloud | Advanced bug detection, used in large-scale open-source and enterprise projects         |

#### Code Example: clang-tidy Usage

Suppose you have code with a likely bug:

```cpp
void printVector(const std::vector<int>& v) {
    for (int i = 0; i <= v.size(); ++i) { // Off-by-one error!
        std::cout << v[i] << '\n';
    }
}
```

Running `clang-tidy` might warn about **potential out-of-bounds access**:

```text
warning: Array access (v[i]) may be out of bounds.
```

#### Advanced Use

- **Integration with CMake**: Static analysis tools such as `clang-tidy` can be integrated via CMake targets, e.g.:

    ```cmake
    set(CMAKE_CXX_CLANG_TIDY "clang-tidy;-checks=*")
    ```

- **Customized Rule Sets**: Tailor warning levels, enable/disable checks specific to your team or project's standards.

#### Why Static Analysis Matters

- **Catch bugs before runtime**: Avoids costly debugging and crashes
- **Ensures code uniformity and readability**
- **Supports large and distributed teams**
- **Automates review of mundane or repetitive issues**

### 2. Dynamic Analysis

**Dynamic analysis** inspects code *while it executes*. It can uncover issues invisible to static analysisâ€”such as actual memory corruption, leaks, or concurrency bugs arising only under certain inputs or workloads.

#### Main Concepts

- **Memory error detection**: Find use-after-free, double delete, buffer overflow, or memory leaks.
- **Undefined behavior**: Catch situations where the C++ standard leaves results unpredictable (such as reading uninitialized memory).
- **Thread safety checks**: Identify data races, deadlocks, and improper synchronization.
- **Code coverage**: Measure which lines, branches, or paths were actually executed during testing.

#### Popular Dynamic Analysis Tools for C++

| Tool             | Main Purpose                     | Notable Features                                       |
|------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Valgrind**     | Memory errors, leaks            | Cross-platform, identifies invalid memory operations   |
| **AddressSanitizer (ASan)** | Memory errors, use-after-free | Fast, compiler-based, integrated with Clang/GCC        |
| **ThreadSanitizer (TSan)**  | Data races, thread bugs         | Detects race conditions, pthread issues                |
| **MemorySanitizer (MSan)**  | Uninitialized memory use        | Advanced, works with Clang                             |
| **LeakSanitizer (LSan)**    | Memory leaks                     | Focused on memory leaks, part of ASan/Tsan             |
| **GDB/PDB/Lldb** | General debugging tools          | Can be scripted/combined for custom runtime checks      |
| **Dr. Memory**   | Memory errors (Windows)          | Easy to use, focuses on memory accesses/leaks          |

#### Code Example: AddressSanitizer

Mistake: Dereferencing a dangling pointer.

```cpp
int* p = new int(42);
delete p;
std::cout << *p << '\n'; // Use after free!
```

Compile and run with ASan:

```bash
g++ -fsanitize=address -g main.cpp -o main
./main
```

Output:

```text
==12345==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: heap-use-after-free on address 0x...
```

#### Memory Leak Example: Valgrind

```cpp
void leak() {
    int* p = new int[10];
    // forgot: delete[] p;
}
```

Run:

```bash
valgrind --leak-check=full ./main
```

Output:

```text
LEAK SUMMARY:
definitely lost: 40 bytes in 1 blocks
```

#### Coverage Tools

- **gcov/llvm-cov**: Show untested code sections, helping focus unit testing efforts.
- **Codecov.io (Cloud)**: Aggregates test/coverage metrics across CI runs.

### 3. Integrating Analysis into Your Workflow

#### Continuous Integration (CI)

- Run static/dynamic analyzers automatically in the CI pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI).
- Fail builds on severe findings or code quality rule violations.
- Collect and visualize results via dashboards (SonarQube, Codecov).

#### IDE Integration

- Modern IDEs (CLion, Visual Studio, VS Code with extensions) run linters, analyzers, sanitizers on-save or during builds, highlighting issues inline for rapid feedback.

#### Best Practices

- **Treat warnings as errors**: `-Werror` flag ensures potential bugs are addressed early.
- **Automate analysis**: Write scripts or configure CI to make analysis part of every commit.
- **Prioritize fixes**: Address critical defects first (e.g., memory corruption, security holes).
- **Educate the team**: Share results so that everyone understands the importance and output of these tools.

### 4. Common Pitfalls and Rules for Quality Analysis

- **False positives**: Static analysis can sometimes report harmless code as problematic. Regularly review and, if appropriate, suppress or configure such warnings.
- **Overlooked dynamic bugs**: Some bugs appear only under rare conditions; use fuzzing and property-based testing to increase dynamic coverage.
- **Performance costs**: Dynamic analysis (like Valgrind or sanitizers) can make programs run much slower. Use them during testing, not production.

#### Key Rules

- **Always initialize variables before use** (catchable by MSan, static analyzers).
- **Free or delete memory exactly once** (ASan/Valgrind).
- **Avoid raw pointers when possible** (static analyzers highlight unsafe pointer patterns).
- **Test for thread safety** if using concurrency primitives (TSan).

### 5. Real-world Example: Combining Tools

Suppose your project uses CMake:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_CLANG_TIDY "clang-tidy;-checks=*")

add_executable(my_app main.cpp)
target_compile_options(my_app PRIVATE -fsanitize=address,undefined)
```

This configuration enables static checks on every build, and if you run the produced executable, memory bugs will be highlighted at runtime.

In a CI YAML (e.g., GitLab):

```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test

test:
  script:
    - cmake -Bbuild .
    - cmake --build build
    - cd build
    - ctest --output-on-failure
    - valgrind ./test_suite
```

---

### 6. Modern C++: Embracing Best Practices

- Favor **tools that support C++20/23**, such as `clang-tidy`, to catch subtle mistakes with new features: concepts, ranges, coroutines.
- Regularly update tools for improved diagnostics on language latest features.
- Review your codebase for **ancient anti-patterns**: manual memory management, macros instead of constexpr, missing smart pointer usage.
- Use **sanitizers during development and CI**, even if you ship release builds without them.
