## 4.3: Enumerations and Enum Classes

Enumerations have evolved significantly in modern C++. Mastery of this feature is essential for writing robust, maintainable, and type-safe code. This section provides a comprehensive guide to both traditional enums and modern enum classes, covering historical context, syntax, semantics, best practices, advanced features, and common real-world use cases.

---

## 1. Traditional (Unscoped) Enums

**Definition and Syntax**

Traditional enums, introduced in original C++, let you define a set of named integer constants grouped under a single type.

```cpp
enum Color {
    Red,
    Green,
    Blue
};
```

- **Underlying type**: By default, the underlying type is `int`.
- **Scope**: Enumerators are injected into the containing scope: you write `Red`, not `Color::Red`.
- **Implicit conversions**: Can be implicitly converted to `int`.

**Usage Example**

```cpp
Color c = Green; // OK
int i = Blue;    // Implicitly converts to int (i == 2)
```

**Downsides**

- **No type safety**: Implicit conversion to `int` can lead to bugs and misuse.
- **Poor scoping**: Enumerators pollute the namespace, risking name collisions.
- **Manual underlying type**: You can't easily specify the underlying type before C++11.

---

## 2. Scoped Enums (Enum Classes): Modern C++ Solution

**Definition and Syntax**

Scoped enums (enum classes), introduced in C++11, address these issues by improving type safety, scoping, and explicit underlying types.

```cpp
enum class Color : uint8_t {
    Red,
    Green,
    Blue
};
```

- **Scope**: Enumerators are scoped to their enum type—must write `Color::Red`.
- **No implicit conversion**: You cannot implicitly convert to `int`.
- **Explicit underlying type**: Specify underlying type (e.g., `uint8_t`, `int`, etc.).
- **Forward declaration**: Enum classes can be forward-declared.

**Usage Example**

```cpp
Color c = Color::Green; // Must use scope prefix
// int i = Color::Blue; // Error: No implicit conversion

// Explicit conversion is required:
int i = static_cast<int>(Color::Blue); // i == 2

// Underlying type guarantees (e.g., storage size)
```

---

## 3. Enum Value Initialization and Ordering

Enumerators can be explicitly initialized:

```cpp
enum class Status {
    Ok = 200,
    NotFound = 404,
    ServerError = 500
};
```

Values without explicit values increment from the previous value. Values can repeat, but uniqueness is generally best practice.

---

## 4. Forward Declaration and Size Control

**Forward Declaration**

Allows referencing enums without definition, aiding encapsulation and header cleanliness.

```cpp
enum class Status : uint8_t;
```

**Storage Efficiency**

Controlling the underlying type is crucial in embedded systems and large data models:

```cpp
enum class Mode : uint16_t {
    Off,
    On,
    Standby
};
```

## 5. enum vs. enum class: Safe Design Choices

| Feature                  | `enum`              | `enum class`          |
|--------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|
| Scope                    | Unscoped            | Scoped                |
| Implicit conversion      | Yes (`enum` → int)  | No                    |
| Underlying type control  | Limited (C++11+)    | Yes (explicit)        |
| Type safety              | Weak                | Strong                |
| Forward declaration      | No                  | Yes                   |

**Best Practice:** Prefer `enum class` for safer, cleaner code with reduced risk of bugs due to unintended conversions and name clashes.

---

## 6. Enum Classes and Strong Typing

With `enum class`, accidental mixing of unrelated values is impossible:

```cpp
enum class Fruit { Apple, Orange };
enum class Color { Red, Green };

// Fruit f = Color::Red; // Error: No implicit conversion
```

This prevents subtle logic errors especially in large and complex codebases.

---

## 7. Advanced Usage Patterns & Real-world Examples

### Bitmask Enums: When to Use

Unscoped enums were historically used for bitmask flags. With `enum class`, you need to overload bitwise operators.

```cpp
enum class Permissions : uint8_t {
    None    = 0,
    Read    = 1 << 0,
    Write   = 1 << 1,
    Execute = 1 << 2
};

// Enable operator overloading to allow bitwise operations:
inline Permissions operator|(Permissions lhs, Permissions rhs) {
    return static_cast<Permissions>(
        static_cast<uint8_t>(lhs) | static_cast<uint8_t>(rhs)
    );
}
```

**Best Practice:** If you use an enum as flags, document and implement bitwise operators explicitly.

### Mapping Enums to Strings

C++ has no built-in introspection for enums. Use utility functions or libraries (`magic_enum`, `BetterEnum`) for converting between enums and strings:

```cpp
std::string to_string(Color c) {
    switch (c) {
        case Color::Red:   return "Red";
        case Color::Green: return "Green";
        case Color::Blue:  return "Blue";
        default:           return "Unknown";
    }
}
```

### Using Enums in Switch Statements

Switch statements benefit from enum classes' strong typing:

```cpp
switch(c) {
    case Color::Red:   // ...
        break;
    case Color::Green: // ...
        break;
    case Color::Blue:  // ...
        break;
}
```

It is best practice to include a `default` clause or assertion for exhaustive handling, especially for enums subject to extension in future standards.

---

## 8. Enum Classes and Forward Compatibility

Adding new values to enum classes is safer due to scoping and switch statement exhaustiveness. This supports maintainability and aids in large team environments.

---

## 9. Pattern Matching and Enums (C++23)

Recent standards enable advanced control flow (`if consteval`, `if constexpr`, and pattern matching proposals). While not directly for enums, using enums with these features increases maintainability and robustness.

```cpp
enum class TrafficColor { Green, Yellow, Red };

auto action(TrafficColor c) {
    switch (c) {
        case TrafficColor::Green:  return "Go";
        case TrafficColor::Yellow: return "Caution";
        case TrafficColor::Red:    return "Stop";
    }
    // Optional: static_assert or unreachable handling
}
```

## 10. Guidelines and Best Practices

- **Prefer `enum class` to unscoped `enum`** except for legacy code or specific bitmask contexts.
- **Explicit underlying type matters** for performance, ABI stability, and portability.
- **Avoid magic numbers**: Enumerators are readable replacements.
- **Do not rely on implicit conversions**; use `static_cast` when required.
- **Overload operators carefully for flag enums.**
- **Map enums to string representations** for logging, debugging, or serialization.
- **Document semantic meaning** for each enumerator—avoid ambiguous names.
- **Use modern tools** (code analyzers, linters) to catch misuse.

---

## 11. Enum Classes in Modern Libraries and Frameworks

Most modern frameworks (Qt, Boost, STL additions) adopt `enum class` for exported APIs due to strong typing and scope-completeness. When contributing or interacting with such libraries, adhere to this style for consistency and safety.

---

## 12. Common Pitfalls and Anti-patterns

- **Implicit conversions** with unscoped enums can lead to subtle bugs.
- **Namespace pollution** from traditional enums is easy to miss.
- **Bitmask enums** with `enum class` require manual operator support.
- **Default values**: Always handle `default` in switches to manage future additions.

---

## 13. Real-world Example: File Permissions

Consider a user management system requiring file permission flags.

```cpp
enum class FilePermission : uint8_t {
    None    = 0,
    Read    = 1 << 0,
    Write   = 1 << 1,
    Execute = 1 << 2
};

FilePermission perms = FilePermission::Read | FilePermission::Write;

// Checking permission:
bool canRead = static_cast<uint8_t>(perms) & static_cast<uint8_t>(FilePermission::Read);
```

This example demonstrates the power and safety of `enum class` combined with explicit operator implementations.

---

## 14. Enum Classes and Templates

Enums are commonly used as non-type template parameters, where strong typing is helpful for clarity:

```cpp
template <Color C>
void do_something();
```

---

## 15. Tools and Libraries

- **magic_enum**: Runtime reflection and string conversion for enums.
- **BetterEnum**: Third-party solution for advanced enum features.
- **Static analysis**: Linters (clang-tidy), code formatters (clang-format) to enforce enum usage guidelines.

## Summary Table: When To Use

| Use Case           | Preferred Enum Type  | Reason                                    |
|--------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Simple type safety | `enum class`        | Scoped and type-safe                      |
| Flags/bitmask      | `enum class` + ops* | Strong typing, explicit operator overload |
| Legacy code        | `enum`              | Compatibility                             |

(*) Implement bitwise operator overloads if needed.
