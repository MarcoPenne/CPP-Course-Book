## 6.4: Perfect Forwarding and Reference Collapsing

### Introduction

Modern C++ programming makes extensive use of generic code—especially via templates and function objects (functors, lambdas, etc.). Achieving both efficiency and flexibility when forwarding arguments (especially to constructors, setters, or wrappers) is a core skill. **Perfect forwarding** and **reference collapsing** are pivotal concepts that enable these advanced idioms, allowing you to write powerful abstractions that impose zero or minimal overhead.

This section will give you deep fluency in these concepts, clarify subtle rules, and lay out best practices as adopted in state-of-the-art C++ (C++11 and onwards).

### Motivation: Why Perfect Forwarding?

Consider a factory function that creates objects by forwarding arguments to a constructor. Ideally, you want the function to work for any argument type (copyable/movable/const/lvalue/rvalue), matching their value category (i.e., lvalue or rvalue) and cv-qualification (const and/or volatile), **without unnecessary copies or moves**.

Traditional function templates risk unnecessary copies, but using perfect forwarding and reference collapsing, you can do this efficiently:
```cpp
template<typename T, typename Arg>
std::unique_ptr<T> make_unique_bad(Arg arg) {
    // arg is always an lvalue inside this function, even if passed an rvalue!
    return std::unique_ptr<T>(new T(arg));
}
```
This version would always copy, never move, even when the user expects optimal move semantics.

---

### Reference Collapsing Rules

Reference collapsing is a set of **compiler rules** that determine what happens when a reference to a reference is formed (often via templates). In C++, references to references aren't allowed, but combining `T&` or `T&&` with another reference creates either an lvalue or rvalue reference, according to these rules:

| Outer \ Inner | `T&`         | `T&&`        |
|:-------------:|:------------:|:------------:|
| `T&`          | `T&`         | `T&`         |
| `T&&`         | `T&`         | `T&&`        |

- **Rule**: If either is an lvalue reference, the result is an lvalue reference. Only `T&&` to `T&&` gives an rvalue reference.

*Example:*
```cpp
template <typename T>
void func(T&& param);      // universal/forwarding reference

int x = 42;
func(x);                  // T = int&, param is int& (lvalue ref collapse)
func(42);                 // T = int,  param is int&& (rvalue)
```

---

### Universal (Forwarding) References

The so-called "universal reference" is a template parameter of the form `T&&` (where `T` is deduced), pivotal for perfect forwarding.

**Key Points:**
- If called with an lvalue, `T` deduces to `X&`, so `param` becomes `X& &&` → **collapses to `X&`**.
- If called with an rvalue, `T` deduces to `X`, so `param` becomes `X&&`.

#### Practical Illustration

```cpp
template <typename T>
void wrapper(T&& arg) {
    callee(std::forward<T>(arg));
}
```
- Passing an lvalue preserves lvalue-ness; passing an rvalue preserves rvalue-ness.
- Using `std::forward<T>(arg)` is *crucial*; it conditionally casts to rvalue if `T` is not an lvalue reference.

---

### The Machinery: `std::forward` and `std::move`

- **`std::move`**: Casts to rvalue *always*, even if the original is actually an lvalue reference. You lose lvalue-ness.
- **`std::forward<T>`**: Forwards value category **based on T**. *Perfect forwarding* is achieved via the correct use of `std::forward`.

*Example: Factory function with perfect forwarding:*
```cpp
template<typename T, typename... Args>
std::unique_ptr<T> make_unique(Args&&... args) {
    return std::unique_ptr<T>(new T(std::forward<Args>(args)...));
}
```
- This lets you forward any number and kind of arguments to the constructor, **without surprise copies or moves**.

---

### Real-World Example: Wrapper Class

Suppose you write a logging wrapper that logs calls to any function, regardless of argument types.

```cpp
class Logger {
public:
    template<typename Func, typename... Args>
    static auto log_and_call(Func&& func, Args&&... args) {
        log("Function called");
        return std::forward<Func>(func)(std::forward<Args>(args)...);
    }
};
```
**Without perfect forwarding, you’d risk both wrong overloads and performance loss.**

---

### Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

- **Never use `std::forward<T>(x)` unless `T` is a template type parameter deduced from `x`.** Otherwise, you'll forward incorrectly.
- **Don’t forward local named variables unless you’re certain they're safe to move from** (e.g., after last use).
- **Overuse of perfect forwarding can make code harder to read; use it wisely.**
- Always test **corner cases**: passing const and non-const lvalues and rvalues, unique pointers, containers, etc.

---

### Code Example: Difference Between std::move and std::forward

```cpp
void foo(std::string&& s);

template <typename T>
void wrapper(T&& x) {
    // Always "moves": wrong if x is an lvalue reference!
    foo(std::move(x));

    // Perfect forwarding: preserves lvalue/rvalue-ness.
    foo(std::forward<T>(x));
}
```

#### Usage
```cpp
std::string s = "text";
wrapper(std::move(s)); // x is rvalue: both std::move and std::forward are "ok"
wrapper(s);            // x is lvalue: std::move(x) wrongly moves s, but std::forward<T>(x) passes as lvalue
```

---

### Advanced Topics

- **`decltype(auto)` and forwarding**: When forwarding return values, prefer `decltype(auto)` to preserve value category.
  ```cpp
  template <typename T>
  decltype(auto) identity(T&& x) {
      return std::forward<T>(x);
  }
  ```
- **SFINAE and forwarding**: Sometimes, you’ll constrain template overloads so only certain forwarding applies—this is advanced usage, often with std::enable_if or concepts (C++20 onward).

---

### Performance and Code Quality

- **Perfect forwarding** avoids unnecessary construction/copying, critical in high-performance systems and generic libraries.
- Modern code should *almost always* use perfect forwarding patterns when forwarding unknown argument types.

---

### Tools and Diagnostics

- Use **static analysis** (Clang-Tidy, CppCheck) to catch misuses of std::move vs. std::forward.
- **Compiler warnings** (`-Wreturn-local-addr`, `-Wmisleading-indentation`, etc.) optionally help detect misplaced forwards.
- **Unit tests**: Always cover lvalue/rvalue/const/move/copy cases in your tests.

### Summary Table: When to Use std::move vs. std::forward

| Situation                        | Use              |
|:----------------------------------|:-----------------|
| Forwarding a template param       | `std::forward<T>`|
| Moving a non-template local var   | `std::move`      |
| Returning a forwarding parameter  | `std::forward<T>`|
| Passing to constructor/factory    | `std::forward<T>`|
